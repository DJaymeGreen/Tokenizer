# Tokenizer
C99 program which implements the basic steps in early compilation. This includes tokenization, parsing, and semantic analysis based on a given
deterministic finite state maching for a simple language. 

Contains three files: classes.h, tokenize.c, and input.1. 

Classes.h contains the character states in the deterministic finite state machine. This code was given (not mine).

Tokenize.c contains the the code that does early, basic compilation. I wrote the entire file.

Input.1 is a sample input file that would be accepted by tokenize.c.
